# ‚òÅÔ∏è Nimbus
Nimbus is a simple, decentralized social media framework, built on PHP and JavaScript, with a focus on privacy, easy setup, and freedom of speech.

# ‚ö° Quick-start guide
To make a site with Nimbus:
- Go to the latest release and download the zip file, `config.json`, and `readme.txt`, upload it wherever you want in your server's files, and unzip it.
- Read the Setup section in `readme.txt` to set up the necessary folders for user profiles, posts, and media.
- Make sure to also check out `config.json` to configure your new platform with character & upload size limits and more.
- Finally, once your site is up and running, make an account with the name `Admin` (capitalization matters!). This account will automatically have access to admin commands 
(full list in `readme.txt`).
